## Website I built for the Coco Rock Cafe, Tarifa, Spain

This is a site I did for my friend's business

## Site completed with jQuery and contains different effects and widgets.

Here you'll find single page fully responsive site with parallax, lazy loading, overlays and geolocation all completed with Flexbox. Please use latest Chrome as site is not debugged.

## Motivation

I just like coding. Last year I decided to learn code and since been "hacking" in my spare time at home. I also enjoy learning and enjoy spending my time on teamtreehouse and listening to Wes Bos podcasts.

## License

If you want to use this site for your purposes, it will cost you One Million Dollars.
